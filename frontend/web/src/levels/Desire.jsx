        <h1>Desire</h1>
        <p>
          Desire motivates vast areas of human activity, including the economy.
          Advertisers play on desires to program us with needs linked to
          instinctual drives. It is linked to jealousy and greed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Desire moves us to expend great effort to achieve goals or obtain
          rewards. The desire for money, prestige, or power runs the lives of
          many of those who have risen above fear as their predominant life
          motive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Desire is also the level of addictions, wherein desire becomes a
          craving more important than life itself. The victims of desire may
          actually be unaware of the basis of their motives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The desire for sexual approval has produced the huge cosmetics and
          fashion industries that extol glamour and allure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Desire has to do with acquisition and accumulation, but satisfaction
          of one desire is merely replaced by the unsatisfied desire for
          something else, so the acquisition is endless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consequence of a life of endless pursuit and anxiety about the
          acquisition of externalised, artificial sources of satisfaction is
          increased exposure to fear of loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cravings can be continuous due to a failure of the internal
          satisfaction mechanism, by which there never seems to be enough, and
          acquisition becomes a lifestyle of endless pursuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social craving is often compensatory to self-doubt and low
          self-esteem. Social expressions of needing and wanting may attach to
          external concepts, political positions, and the need to control others
          for the sought-after feelings of importance and public attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basic problem with this level of consciousness is the inner
          feeling of lack that results in chronic dissatisfaction. The ego
          becomes infatuated with its own projections of attractiveness onto
          external objects, without recognising the value of what it already
          possesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ego's inner anxiety about fulfillment of its projected needs leads
          to an insatiable greed for power and control over others that emerges,
          in its most expanded form, as a desire to dominate the entire world.
