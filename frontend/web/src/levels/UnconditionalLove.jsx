        <h1>Unconditional Love, Joy, Ecstasy</h1>
        <p>
          As love becomes increasingly unconditional, it begins to be
          experienced as inner joy. This is not the sudden joy of a pleasurable
          turn of events, but instead a constant accompaniment to all
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joy arises from within each moment of existence rather than from any
          outer source. It is also the level of healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Characteristic of this energy field is a capacity for enormous
          patience and the persistence of a positive attitude in the face of
          prolonged adversity. The hallmark of this state is compassion. People
          who have attained this level have a notable effect on others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world one sees is illuminated by the exquisite beauty and
          perfection of creation. Everything happens effortlessly by
          synchronicity, and one sees the world and everything in it as an
          expression of Love and Divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individual will merges into Divine will. One feels the power of the
          Presence that facilitates phenomena outside conventional expectations
          of reality—termed “miraculous” by the ordinary observer. These
          phenomena represent the power of the energy field, not of the
          individual. In other words, the energy field is the soul—a part of the
          Divine—that makes everything happen, not the particular individual in
          a human physical form. The soul is all-powerful because it is a part
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The emergence of progressively higher levels of consciousness requires
          periods of adjustment, much like adapting to a new pair of glasses. In
          this process, worldly function may be impaired periodically due to
          shifts in orientation. Phenomena are discovered to be happening
          spontaneously, rather than through the presumed linear principle of
          cause and effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also progressively discovered that there is no “doer” of
          actions, and one witnesses the autonomous unfoldment of karmic
          potentiality from a new paradigm of reality—one that transcends the
          presumptive dualistic principle of causation. Thus, life becomes an
          endless series of revelations of intrinsic charm and delight that
          initially seem miraculous. Then comes the realisation that what
          appears miraculous is simply the constant unfolding of the
          potentiality of Creation, by which the subjective experience of time
          dissolves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, the perception of “change” is replaced by the progressive
          emergence of the ongoingness of Creation as the fulfillment of
          potentiality actualising into manifestation.
        </p>
        <p>
          With neither past nor future, there is also no “now”—and it is
          comprehended that past, present, and future are all illusory
          contextualisations resulting from the limitations of a linear
          paradigm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shift forward merely requires the surrendering of all belief
          systems, and the understanding that all fear is illusion. Nothing is
          actually the way the ego has perceived it, for the linear dimension is
          merely presumptive. The nonlinear absolute is a very different
          paradigm, one that operates on entirely different
          principles—principles that are self-revealing rather than based on
          sequential understanding or comprehension.
