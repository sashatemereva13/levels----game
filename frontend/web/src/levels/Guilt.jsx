        <h1>Guilt and Vindictive Hate</h1>
        <p>
          Guilt is the consequence of the memory of regretted past actions as
          they are recalled. These can be transcended by recontextualisation —
          mistakes are the natural, impersonal consequence of learning and
          development, and therefore unavoidable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Used as: blame to manipulate and punish, for coercion and control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manifests as: remorse, penance, self-hatred, self-punishment, suicide,
          self-abnegation, self-propagating addiction, self-recrimination,
          masochism, victimhood, feeling undeserving of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>Guilt is a learned behaviour with major psychological components.</p>
        <p>
          A spiritual paradox is represented by the religious teaching of
          "hating sin," which merely expresses the very thing it deplores.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bypass guilt: feel compassion, forgiveness, and realise that
          individuals are limited, ignorant, and don’t always understand what
          they do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guilt can be an educative emotion that arises as a warning not to
          repeat the same mistake. The past cannot be rewritten, but it can be
          recontextualised so as to become the source of constructive learning.
        </p>
        <p>The literal, absolute definition of the word “sin” is “error.”</p>
        <p>
          Self-forgiveness is facilitated by humility and acceptance of
          limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excessive guilt and remorse are a disguised form of egotism, in which
          the self becomes blown up, exaggerated, and the hero of the tragedy —
          the negativity of which feeds the ego. Release from guilt requires
          surrender of this egotism, because the ego reenergises itself through
          the negativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I should have known better” is another egoic position that brings in
          the hypothetical, which is always fallacious. Wallowing in guilt is
          feeding the ego and is an indulgence.
        </p>
        <p>
          In psychological terms, the source of guilt is the superego, so named
          by Freud. This is the part of the mind comprised of introjected
          judgments, points of view, and learned content.
        </p>
        <p>
          A hypertrophied superego can be the source of excessive guilt. When
          projected onto others, it justifies vindictiveness in extreme forms as
          revenge against the “evil” enemy. This rationalises killing others as
          their being “deserving” of death. The worst ravages of humanity have
          often been done in the name of God — the classic Luciferic inversion
          of good and evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is not a sadist, so self-degradation or self-punishment serves
          neither God nor one’s fellow humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reluctance to forgive is a consequence of the illusion that others do
          not “deserve” it. In reality, it is the forgiver — not the forgiven —
          who benefits the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forgiveness cannot be done by the ego/mind because it lacks the
          necessary power when caught up in the energy field of hate, which
          calibrates at only 30. The transformative source of power cannot
          originate from the mind or the personality called the personal “I.”
          The necessary power resides in the nonlinear quality of consciousness
          termed the “will.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Guilt-ridden cultures commonly have a negative view of God as
          judgmental, vindictive, angry, and punitive — seen through natural
          disasters contextualised as punishment for wickedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The public often expresses concern that the guilty might go
          unpunished. Anyone familiar with the reality of consciousness realises
          that no such thing is possible. Everyone is accountable to the
          universe and is subject to Divine Justice by the very dynamics of the
          universe itself. There are no accidents in the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal past history represents the best that one could have done
          then, under the given circumstances — which included one’s perceptions
          and emotional-mental states at the time. Every given moment includes
          limitation. What we were is not what we are now. Mistakes are
          intrinsic to the learning process, which is the fate of the human
          condition itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the long run, the consequences of merely being kind to others and
          to all of life have far greater positive results than worldly success
          as defined by the ego. It is beneficial to periodically reassess goals
          and ask whether they are really important — or just the consequence of
          egotism.
        </p>
        <p>
          True success is simply the automatic consequence of being the best
          that one can be as a lifestyle, without looking for gain.
