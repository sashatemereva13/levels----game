Levels — Game Contract (Selfinder-themed narrative engine)
What this project is
Levels is a web-based narrative exploration engine inspired by Choose Your Own Adventure books. Players move through short, poetic “moments” (pages) and choose between options that lead them deeper into a state of consciousness. Each story represents one Level (e.g., Fear, Desire, Acceptance, Love), inspired by the “Map of the Scale of Consciousness” concept.

What a “Level” is (Story)
A Level is a self-contained journey through a specific emotional/energetic landscape.
It is not a lesson or a lecture; it is an experience expressed through literature-style text and symbolic choices.
A Level can be visited at any time (non-linear exploration).
The same Level can be replayed; different choices may reveal different outcomes.
What a “Moment” is (Page)
A Moment is one scene/state inside a Level.
It contains:
poetic text (evocation, not explanation)
a set of choices (0+)
Some moments are endings: they close the run.
What a “Choice” is
A choice is not “correct vs incorrect”.
A choice represents a way of relating to the experience:
staying present vs escaping
naming vs feeling
surrender vs control
opening vs defending
etc.
Choices are designed to support self-projection (the player recognizes themselves in what they pick).
What an “Ending” is (no “failure” screen)
There is no failure in the moral sense.
Endings represent closure states: how the Level was met.
Each ending has a clear Ending Label shown on the end screen (Level 13 requirement). Example labels:
Integration — the experience is lived through; something resolves.
Avoidance — the experience is bypassed; relief without digestion.
Loop — the pattern repeats; no real exit is found.
Collapse — intensity overwhelms; the Level closes abruptly.
Neutral Closure — nothing breaks, nothing opens; it ends quietly.
These are descriptive, not judgmental.
What “winning” means (softly)
There is no global “win”. The goal is exploration.
However, some endings can be treated as “more integrated” than others purely for reflection/statistics, not punishment.
What statistics mean
Stats are used to reveal patterns (individual + collective), not to rank the player.
We track:
total plays per story (Level)
distribution of endings (counts and %)
(later) a player path visualization (how choices tended to flow)
What the game is NOT
Not an MMO, not real-time combat, not a physics game.
Not a “teaching platform” with lectures.
Not a therapy/medical tool (it’s an artful self-reflection experience).
